Open source finance tracking. Free. Forever.

### Problem
Every year, powerful personal finance tracking software grows more and more expensive. This software also provides little flexibility to adapt to the needs of the user, and does not provide sufficient automation options for power users. Using a simple spreadsheet is an option, but that can't easily interact with outside sites and is also very difficult for those who aren't as familiar with technology.

### Solution
An open source solution, where users will be able to create budgets and track their earning and spending to make sure they stay within it. By creating an open source solution, the code base will be free, forever. No chance of the price being raised, the code will always be available to the public. Since the code is publicly available, it is also easy for power users to write extensions to create the features from their wildest dreams. If a feature does not already exist, the user, or someone else in the community, can create it.

#### Feature Plans
- [ ] Basic income/purchase input and categorization
- [ ] Automated synchronization with bank accounts
- [ ] Budget management
- [ ] Sufficient Security Measures
- [ ] Cloud Syncing
- [ ] Custom basic scripting language for integrating more complex automation
- [ ] Different views for users of different levels
- [ ] Sufficient documentation, making it easy for anyone to understand and use
